To use this monitor you need GRPCurl

https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl<br><br>

Use any text file editor but i recommend Visual Studio Code for best visualization<br>
Edit $ports for each node. You can find this in your node config files.<br>
node-config.json for smapp<br>
config-mainnet.json for go-spacemesh<br><br>

Script supports as many nodes as you want.<br>
Use "#" to comment out the options you don't need<br><br>

Please note that to access Nodes remotely you need to change config.mainnet.json to<br>
`grpc-private-listener": "0.0.0.0:9093`<br><br>
